# 3d-Project
Experimental coding Physics Engine with OpenGL. 
BEWARE : OLD AND UGLY CODE / PROJECT MANAGEMENT AHEAD

# What is this?
My first attempt at OpenGL (and GIT for that matter) and brute forcing a physics engine without knowing how to take advantage of hardware properly. This code is AS-IS.
If you manage to get the Visual Studio solution to compile, check out the various projects. I was quite proud of Simple3D, which is where the core physics engine implementation lives.

# Why is this here?
As a reminder that I can do better than this and hope to recreate what I was attempting with better code and programming techniques.
